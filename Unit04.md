**Unit 4: Knowledge Is Power** <span id="4"></span> 
*In a world where knowledge is power, and where you have access to
information on virtually anything at your fingertips, you need to learn
how to make sense of and sort through your resources. In this unit, you
will practice locating and integrating information from multiple sources
by reading selected short texts about some pivotal events in American
history. You will learn to compare and contrast various authors’
perspectives and approaches to presenting information and to
differentiate between credible and less useful resources. Once you have
gained some experience, you will select a topic of your choice to
explore more deeply through research. After gaining some expertise on
your topic, you will write and publish an informational article that
presents your research findings and incorporates technology, graphics,
and multimedia components. *

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take approximately 16 hours and 45
minutes.

**4.2 Reading Literature: “Paul Revere’s Ride”** <span id="4.2"></span> 
*Now that you have some background on the events that occurred during
the American Revolution on the day of April 19, 1775, you will add to
your knowledge by reading a different account of the happenings of that
day in the classic poem “Paul Revere’s Ride.”*

**4.2.1 Reading Literature: “Paul Revere’s Ride”** <span
id="4.2.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s “Paul Revere’s Ride”**
    Link: Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s [“Paul Revere’s
    Ride”](http://www.bartleby.com/42/789.html) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Before you begin reading, add a fifth subheading to
    your notes that you started taking above and title it “Paul Revere’s
    Ride.” Then read this poem that was written in 1860 by Henry
    Wadsworth Longfellow, who wasn’t alive to experience the events of
    the American Revolutions. However, his poem includes similarities to
    the accounts of the events of April 19, 1775, that you read above.
    As you read, be sure to accurately record in your notebook the
    dates, people, and details of the events described in the poem.  
        
     Reading this text and taking notes should take approximately 30
    minutes.

     Instructions: Print a copy of the activity above, or copy the chart
    into you notebook. Then, review your notes and look back at the
    texts to complete each section of the chart with the proper
    information. After analyzing the information in the chart, answer
    the question at the bottom of the chart in 2 - 3 complete sentences.
    Completing this activity will help you to see how the perspective of
    the author influences the information provided in a text. You’ll
    also notice how some details are similar, while others are very
    different. These are important ideas to keep in mind when you begin
    to research for your own informational article, because you’ll see
    the importance of looking at multiple resources for information
    rather than just relying on one source.  
        
     Completing this activity should take approximately 45 minutes.

**4.3 The Research Process** <span id="4.3"></span> 
*The texts that you read in the previous lesson about the events of
April 19, 1775, were all thoroughly researched by the authors who wrote
them. Furthermore, when you completed the integrating information and
text comparison activity in the previous subunit, you conducted some
research by looking for information in multiple sources.*  
    
 *During the following lessons, you will learn how to move through the
research process in a more independent manner. You’ll eventually use
what you learn through these lessons to conduct your own research
project, which you’ll use to write your own informational article.
Research skills are essential not only in Language Arts, but also in
Science and Social Studies classes. *

     Instructions: View the explanation lesson that shows an example of
    a person thinking through how to begin the research process. Though
    your research topics and questions will differ from those in this
    lesson, it is important to think through exactly how and where to
    begin when it is your job to conduct research. Once you’ve viewed
    the lesson, open your notebook to a new page and title it “Research
    Plan.” Next, devise a step-by-step plan for how you’ll begin the
    research process, where you plan to locate resources (online, at a
    library, a museum, etc.), the types of resources you think you’ll
    use, and any other details that you think would help you get started
    with your research. Your research plan should include at least four
    different steps of action to help guide your process.

    effectively summarize information from resources without writing
    down too much information or without plagiarizing, which means
    copying directly from a source. As usual, be sure to record main
    ideas and helpful hints from the tutorial in your notebook.  
        
     Watching this tutorial and taking notes should take approximately
    15 minutes.

    Format”](http://www.sophia.org/mla-bibliography-general-format/mla-bibliography-general-format--2-tutorial) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Because you’ve been learning to locate and use a
    number of resources to find information, it is appropriate for you
    to learn how to give credit to the people who worked hard to create
    those resources. The proper way to identify resources that you
    gather information from is through a bibliography or works cited
    page. If you fail to credit other people for their work, then
    plagiarism (which was discussed in the previous lesson) becomes an
    issue. There are many different styles for citing research; in this
    course we will use MLA style, which is used most often in K-12
    schools.  
        
     Create a new subheading in your notes titled “Bibliography.” Watch
    the video lesson, and pause the lesson at each new slide so that you
    can record the proper form for recording that particular resource in
    your notes. It may also be helpful to copy down the provided
    examples. You will be responsible for creating a bibliography later
    in this course, so taking precise and thorough notes will make your
    work easier in the future.  
        
     Watching this tutorial and taking notes should take approximately
    30 minutes.

**4.4 Research** <span id="4.4"></span> 
*This unit will give you the opportunity to apply what you learned in
the previous lessons as you select a topic of your choice and research
it using multiple resources. *

**4.4.1 Selecting a Topic** <span id="4.4.1"></span> 
-   **Explanation: SOPHIA: Emma Allen’s “Picking a Research Topic”**
    Link: SOPHIA: Emma Allen’s [“Picking a Research
    Topic”](http://www.sophia.org/picking-a-research-topic-tutorial) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Create a new heading in your notebook titled “Topic
    Brainstorm.” Then, begin by reading over the “New Terms” and “What
    Interests You?” sections of this tutorial. Once you’re finished
    reading, write the questions “Who interests me?” and “Who do I want
    to learn more about?” on your paper. For the purposes of this
    course, you will have some choice of topic but will be limited to
    selecting a notable or historic figure with numerous texts written
    about him or her. Your person could be an inventor, a historical
    figure, a world leader, an activist, an athlete, a politician, or
    whoever interests you. Write for 5 - 10 minutes about whatever comes
    to your mind as answers to those questions. This is called free
    writing. If you come up with some good ideas in that amount of time,
    move on to the “What Can Background Reading Do For Me?” section, and
    if you haven’t, free write for as long as you need to generate some
    interesting topic ideas. Then watch the “Picking a Topic” video
    lesson to help you narrow down your ideas and select a specific
    topic for research. As usual, record any main ideas or helpful tips
    from this tutorial in your notebook.  
        
     After you have worked through this entire tutorial, it is time for
    you to make a definite decision on the topic that you’d like to
    research and on which you’ll eventually write an informational
    article. Be sure to keep in mind the tips for topic selection from
    this lesson and pick a topic that is interesting to you, is specific
    and not too general, and is one on which you’ll be able to find
    plenty of resources. When you write your informational article,
    you’ll be expected to write at least five paragraphs on this topic,
    so you want to be sure you’re picking a topic that has some depth.
    Once you have decided on your final topic, write it at the bottom of
    your notes page and circle it.  
        
     Completing the tutorial, taking notes, brainstorming, and deciding
    on a topic should take approximately 1 hour.

    your topic and now it is time for you to collect research
    information about your topic from multiple, credible resources. This
    is where you’ll have to do some independent work to locate resources
    in books, online, or by visiting places to collect information.
    Review your notes from all Subunits of Unit 4.3 for ideas on what
    types of resources to use and how to evaluate those resources for
    credibility. As you find and explore resources, fill in information
    on the “Research Record” sheet provided in this lesson. You must
    locate research information from at least three credible sources and
    summarize your findings on the handout provided before moving on to
    the next lesson.  
        
     Locating resources and completing this research activity on your
    topic should take approximately 3 hours.

**4.5 Writing an Informational Article** <span id="4.5"></span> 
*Now that you’ve gained experience with reading like a writer, making
your way through the research process, and reading informational text,
it is time to combine the skills associated with all of these activities
and apply them as you write your own informational article about your
research topic. The lessons in this unit will help you to organize your
writing and will take you through the steps of the writing process,
ending in a final published draft.*

    your completed rough draft. Review the information about writing
    hooks before you get started. Select the type of hook you want to
    write to begin your introduction paragraph.  
        
     Use a word processing program to compose this rough draft. Refer to
    the guidelines provided in this link as you write so that you
    include all required information in your article. Refer to your
    research notes and prewriting to organize your text, and compose a
    rough draft that is written in complete sentences and includes an
    introductory paragraph, at least four subheading sections and
    paragraphs, and a concluding paragraph. Though your rough draft
    isn’t expected to be perfect, it should be written to include the
    items on the “Getting Started: Rough Draft” handout.  
        
     Writing your rough draft should take approximately 1 hour and 30
    minutes.

     Instructions: Use the checklist provided to finish revising and
    editing your personal narrative. Be sure to check each item on the
    list and then evaluate yourself. If you notice that something needs
    to be changed, removed, or added, make those revisions now. Remember
    that revision is all about adding information and details where more
    clarity is needed, and taking out unnecessary information. After
    completing the items on the revision part of the checklist, move to
    the editing section, where you will focus on correcting spelling,
    grammar, and conventions. Upon completion of this checklist, your
    writing piece should be thoroughly polished and complete. The only
    step you have left in the writing process is to publish it using
    technology and to include some extra visual and multimedia features
    to add an extra interesting dimension to your article.  
        
     Revising and editing your writing using this checklist should take
    approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes.
