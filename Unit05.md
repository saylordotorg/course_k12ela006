**Unit 5: The Art of Arguing** <span id="5"></span> 
*Beginning at a young age, most people discover that it is part of human
nature to argue. Just today, in 20 minutes of watching television with
my daughter, I observed a single character argue with siblings over who
had to do a chore, argue with a parent about getting a pet, argue with a
teacher over a homework assignment, and argue with a friend about what
to do for fun. Though the arguments people may make in life will greatly
vary, there is a single common denominator of every strong argument.
Substantial support, in the form of reliable evidence and relevant
reasoning, is the difference between a strong argument and a weak,
unsupported claim.*  
    
 *During this unit, you will learn to read argumentative writing through
the lens of a writer. You will write your own arguments and back them up
with research-based reasons and evidence. Additionally, you will create
a multimedia presentation that will add to your persuasive argument, and
you will engage in argument via a collaborative online discussion board.
Perfecting this art of arguing is a skill that will serve you well in
all aspects of your life, both now and in your future.*

**5.3 Writing an Argumentative Essay** <span id="5.3"></span> 
*This series of lessons will guide you through the process of writing an
argumentative essay. You will first select a topic about which you have
a strong opinion, and then you will conduct background research to
locate evidence in support of your opinion. Next, you will write,
revise, edit, and then publish your argumentative essay. *

    statement about your argument, so pay close attention to the
    examples provided in the tutorial.  
        
     After watching this video lesson, it is your turn to select a topic
    to argue and support in an argumentative essay. Use the strategies
    and steps (looking at news sources, making an interest list, etc.)
    discussed in the video lesson to help you brainstorm and select a
    topic of your own. Don’t forget to select a topic that is arguable,
    not one that is a proven scientific fact.  
        
     Completing this activity and selecting your topic should take
    approximately 1 hour.

     Instructions: After defining your argument, it is time for you to
    collect some evidence and data to support your opinion. As with any
    research you will conduct, your supporting evidence should be
    collected from multiple credible resources. At this point, you’ll
    need to do some independent work to locate resources in books,
    online, or by visiting places to collect information. Review your
    notes from all subunits of Unit 4.3 for ideas about what types of
    resources to use and how to evaluate those resources for
    credibility. As you find and explore resources, fill in information
    on the “Research Record” sheet provided in this lesson. You must
    locate research information from at least three credible sources and
    summarize your findings on the handout before moving on to the next
    lesson. Be sure to focus on finding and recording research evidence
    that is directly related to your argument and that truly provides
    information that supports your opinion, not just information that is
    related to your topic.  
        
     Locating resources and completing this research activity should
    take approximately 3 hours.

    Essay (Concept
    5)”](http://www.sophia.org/revising-and-editing-the-persuasive-essay-concept-tutorial) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Add “Revising and Editing the Persuasive Essay” as a
    subtitle in your argumentative writing notes in your notebook. Then,
    watch this video tutorial on expectations for revising and editing.
    You may fast forward it to the 30-second mark and begin watching it
    at that point, as the first 30 seconds contains information
    irrelevant to you from the teacher who recorded it for her own
    class. Record in your notebook any helpful tips, information, or new
    concepts that you learn as you watch it. Then, take the quiz
    provided on the right side of the screen to quiz yourself on how
    well you understood the information presented in the tutorial.  
        
     Watching the tutorial, taking notes, and completing the quiz should
    take approximately 30 minutes.

    Revision Checklist”**
    Link: The Saylor Foundation: Amy Kasten’s [“Argumentative Essay
    Revision
    Checklist”](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/K12ELA6-5.3.3.1-Amy-Kastens-Argumentative-Essay-Revision-Checklist.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Use the revision checklist provided to revise your
    argumentative essay. Be sure to check each item on the list and then
    evaluate yourself. If you notice that something needs to be changed,
    removed, or added to, make those revisions now. Remember that
    revision is all about adding information and details where more
    clarity is needed, and taking out unnecessary information. You don’t
    need to worry about correcting spelling, grammar, and conventions
    yet; that will come during the editing process.  
        
     During this revision process, you *must* use the sentence analysis
    revision strategy discussed in the video tutorial that you watched
    in the previous lesson to analyze at least 20 sentences included in
    your essay. Use the sentence analysis chart that is part of the
    revision checklist linked above to complete this part of the
    revision process.  
        
     Revising your writing using the sentence analysis sheet and
    revision checklist should take approximately 2 hours.

     Instructions: Use this editing checklist to proofread your
    argumentative essay for errors. Be sure to check each item on the
    list and then evaluate yourself. What areas were your strengths? In
    which grammar and convention areas do you need to improve? What can
    you do to grow in these areas?  
        
     Editing your writing using this checklist should take approximately
    45 minutes.

    Format”](http://www.sophia.org/mla-bibliography-general-format/mla-bibliography-general-format--3-tutorial) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: You should already have a general familiarity with
    bibliographies from the information that you learned in Subunit
    4.3.6 of this course. This tutorial is a brief review of that
    information, as well as a step-by-step instructional video on how to
    write your own bibliography. You should refer to your notes from
    Subunit 4.3.6 in your notebook and add any new information to them
    as you watch this tutorial. Then, follow the step-by-step directions
    shared in this lesson to create your own typed bibliography listing
    the resources from which you gathered your information for this
    argumentative essay. (You should have already recorded those sources
    on your “Research Record,” completed during Subunit 5.3.1.2. Refer
    back to that if you don’t remember all of the resources that you
    used). Once you have typed your bibliography, add it as the last
    page of your argumentative essay.  
        
     Watching this tutorial, reviewing your notes, and writing your
    bibliography should take approximately 1 hour.

**5.3.5 Creating an Audio/Multimedia Presentation** <span
id="5.3.5"></span> 
-   **Explanation: SOPHIA: Greg Kilpatrick’s “How to Use Prezi”**
    Link: SOPHIA: Greg Kilpatrick’s [“How to Use
    Prezi”](http://www.sophia.org/how-to-use-prezi-tutorial) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: The last part of your argumentative essay-writing
    experience is to create a multimedia presentation that will serve as
    additional means of arguing your case in a more creative manner. The
    tutorial above gives a brief explanation of Prezi, a free online
    presentation-making tool. You are not limited to using Prezi as your
    means of creating a multimedia presentation; however, it’s a great
    place to start if you don’t have any other preferred
    presentation-making tools.  
        
     Once you have decided what presentation tool you want to use, you
    should create a presentation that clearly depicts your argument and
    at least three pieces of supporting evidence. It should also include
    at least one audio element (sound effects, music, a sound clip, a
    recording of your voice, a video clip, etc.), at least one graphic
    element, and at least one video clip that relates to your topic.
    Creating and sharing multimedia presentations will be a skill that
    you will use often between now and high school, and even later in
    your life when you have a job.  
        
     Creating a multimedia presentation should take approximately 3
    hours.

**5.3.6 Collaborative Sharing and Discussion** <span id="5.3.6"></span> 
-   **Activity: Publishing Your Piece**
    After taking your argumentative paper through the steps of the
    writing process, it is now time to publish and share your piece.
    Once you have added a bibliography to your final essay, you may want
    to share your published work with others in the [Saylor Foundation
    Forums](http://forums.saylor.org/topic/argumentative-essay/) or on a
    personal blog. You could also share it with family and friends using
    the share options on Google Drive or by printing it off and
    circulating a hard copy. Enjoy the results of your hard work in the
    writing process - you now have a published piece of which you should
    be very proud!  
        
     Publishing and sharing your final essay should take approximately
    30 minutes.
