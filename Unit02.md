**Unit 2: The World of Childhood** <span id="2"></span> 
*In this unit, you will read the classic tale of* Peter Pan*, the boy
with a never-ending childhood, as well as parts of Mark Twain’s memoir,*
Life on the Mississippi*, which includes memories of his childhood
growing up in a Mississippi River town. As you read, you will focus on
reading like a writer. You will learn to pay close attention to how an
author develops story elements, uses descriptive details, and structures
plot events so that readers are engaged in the story.*  
    
 *After analyzing* Peter Pan *and* Life on the Mississippi *and
challenging yourself to think like a writer, you will write a narrative
of your own. You will learn the six major traits of strong writing and
practice incorporating these into your own skill set. You will also
review the steps of the writing process, and you will work your way
through each one as you publish a personal narrative based on a
memorable event from your own childhood.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take approximately 16 hours and 15

**2.1 Reading Literature: Peter Pan** <span id="2.1"></span> 
*You will be reading the classic novel Peter Pan by J. M. Barrie. As you
read this novel about a never-ending childhood, you should read it for
enjoyment. However, you should read with another purpose in mind, as
well. You will be reading this text like a writer, looking at its
success as a narrative, which is something you’ll begin learning how to
write later in this unit.*

**2.1.1 Reading Like a Writer** <span id="2.1.1"></span>

     Instructions: Create a new section in your notebook for this unit
    and title it “Reading Like a Writer.” Then, read this entire
    nonfiction text and annotate it - or take notes on it - in your
    notebook. This text will help you to understand how you should go
    about reading the novel, *Peter Pan*, which you will read as you
    complete this unit of the course. Our focus throughout this unit is
    on learning to read like a writer, and in turn, becoming a narrative
    writer.  
        
     Once you have read this text, answer the following questions in
    your notebook. All answers should be written in complete sentences
    and should begin with a restatement of the question. Each answer
    should be a minimum of 2 - 3 sentences in length. If you need to,
    look back in your notes and the article for help with your
    answers.  

    -   How is reading like a writer similar to how you usually read?
        How is it different?
    -   What is a technique or strategy you noticed in this essay that
        you could try in your own writing?
    -   How can you learn about the context of a text before you start
        to read it?

    Reading this document and taking notes should take approximately 30
    minutes.

    should be at least 1 complete sentence, while your answers to
    questions 3 and 4 should be at least 2 - 3 complete sentences in
    length. If you are unable to completely answer a question now,
    revisit these questions and add to your answers after reading the
    first few chapters of the text.  

    -   What purpose did the author have for writing this text?
    -   For what audience did the author write this text?

        own at the conclusion of this unit, what can you learn about
        writing from reading this text?

    After answering these questions, begin reading *Peter Pan*. Read the
    first eight chapters, and then revise and add to your answers to the
    questions above. You should then move forward and complete the
    remaining lessons in this section as you finish reading the rest of
    the story.  
        
     Reading *Peter Pan* and answering these questions should take
    approximately 6 hours.

**2.4 Writing a Personal Narrative** <span id="2.4"></span> 
*You’ve spent quite a bit of time during this unit reading a narrative
and a personal account, both relating to childhood. Now it is your turn
to become the author! The following lessons will help you organize your
ideas and lead you through the writing process of composing your own
personal narrative.*

    Link: SOPHIA: Rebecca Oberg’s [“Creative
    Writing”](http://www.sophia.org/creative-writing-tutorial) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Watch and read the activities in this tutorial. Pay
    special attention to the video lesson on writing a memoir and the
    following notes on the writing process. Take notes on any
    information that you feel is important or will be helpful to your
    writing.  
        
     During this unit, you have read two very different stories that
    relate to childhood. *Peter Pan* was a story of a boy with a
    never-ending childhood, and *Life on the Mississippi* chronicled
    some memories from Mark Twain’s youth. Now it is your turn to write
    your own story about childhood!  
        
     The next several activities will help you to select an event from
    your childhood that you will write about in your personal narrative.
    As you begin to think of ideas, keep in mind that the best personal
    narratives focus on a very specific event. For example, writing
    about a family vacation is a general childhood memory, whereas
    writing about winning a sand castle contest while on that family
    vacation would be a more specific event.  
        
     Your task is to brainstorm a list of at least five possible ideas
    for your personal narrative. Try to make sure that your ideas meet
    the following criteria as this will make writing your story much
    more enjoyable for you:  

    -   The event you choose to write about should be a single, solitary
        event from your childhood.
    -   This event should be something that taught you a lesson.
    -   The event should have changed you in some way.

    (If you’re stuck, some possible ideas could be learning to play a
    game or sport, the birth of a sibling, your first day of school or
    something new, an injury or illness, a traumatic experience, meeting
    a hero, etc.)  
        
     Watching this tutorial, taking notes, and brainstorming ideas for
    your childhood personal narrative should take approximately 30
    minutes.

     Instructions: Read through the slides and watch the video lesson in
    the tutorial. Use this information to review the different parts of
    a fiction story. Then, in your notebook, open to an empty page and
    divide it into three sections. Label the first section “beginning,”
    the second section “middle,” and the third section “ending.” Now in
    each section, brainstorm 1 - 3 plot events that will occur in your
    narrative at the beginning, middle, and end of the story. You will
    use this plot event brainstorm as you write your first draft, so be
    sure to be thoughtful in your planning, as it will help the actual
    writing go smoothly for you.  
        
     Watching this tutorial and completing your plot pre-writing

     Instructions: Read through the explanation on writing a lead and
    complete the activity described. Look for and categorize the way
    authors of different stories that you enjoy have chosen to begin
    their writing. Then, think about which type of hook you would like
    to create as you begin your personal narrative.  
        
     Once you’ve brainstormed about your hook a bit, it is time to start
    writing. In your notebook or on a computer, begin writing your first
    draft. First, craft your engaging hook using the ideas presented in
    the explanation above, and then continue writing the first draft of
    your story. Be sure to refer to your prewriting plans for plot
    events, characterization, and theme as you develop your story. If
    you are writing by hand in your notebook, skipping lines will be
    helpful because you’ll need room to revise and edit your work.

     Instructions: Use the revision checklist provided to revise your
    personal narrative. Be sure to check each item on the list and then
    evaluate yourself. If you notice that something needs to be changed,
    removed, or added to, make those revisions now. Remember that
    revision is all about adding information and details where more
    clarity is needed, and taking out unnecessary information. You don’t
    need to worry about correcting spelling, grammar, and conventions
    yet; that will come during the editing process.  
        
     Revising your writing using this checklist should take
    approximately 1 hour.

    After taking your personal narrative through the steps of the
    writing process, it is now time to publish your piece. Be certain
    that you have thoroughly edited and proofread your writing, and then
    select some form of word-processing program to publish. Google Drive
    is a helpful, free word processing program that you may be
    interested in trying out. Once you have finished typing your final
    piece, you may want to share your published work with others in the
    [Saylor Foundation
    Forums](http://forums.saylor.org/topic/2-4-5-publishing/) or on a
    personal blog. Enjoy the results of your hard work in the writing
    process - you now have a published piece of which you should be very
    proud!  
        
     Publishing your final piece using technology should take
    approximately 30 minutes.
