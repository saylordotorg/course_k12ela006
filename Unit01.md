**Unit 1: Under the Sea** <span id="1"></span> 
*This unit takes us on a journey to an unfamiliar place - the world that
exists under the sea. During this unit, you will read Jules Verne’s
classic novel, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, as well as a
number of informational texts and articles about marine biology,
environmental issues affecting oceanic waters, and shipwrecks. Each text
you will read is not only associated with Earth’s oceans and seas but
also deals with the underlying theme of the struggle between people and
nature.  
    
 To prepare you for the extensive array of new vocabulary words that you
will encounter in your reading, you will begin this unit by studying
strategies for determining the meanings of unknown words. In addition,
you will be introduced to a number of root words and affixes that are
part of words related to the study of water, oceans, and life. These
word parts and vocabulary-building strategies will help you decode new
words that you encounter both in your readings during this course and in
your life beyond it.  
    
 Finally, you will synthesize your thoughts about the information you
have read by learning to write logical arguments about your opinion on
environmental issues related to Earth’s oceans. You will focus on
developing arguments supported by substantial research-based evidence
and clear reasoning. Writing evidence-based claims will be a skill that
you will continue to develop later in this course and as you progress
through your academic career.*

**1.1 Language** <span id="1.1"></span> 
*A person’s vocabulary is a powerful piece of that person’s ability to
communicate with, understand, and make a positive impression on other
people. The following lessons are focused on helping you to build your
vocabulary in a number of ways. First, you will review how to use
context clues in text or conversations to determine the meaning of
unknown words. Then, you will arm yourself with knowledge of the meaning
of a number of word parts that will resurface in many words you will
encounter throughout your life. Finally, you will learn how to use a
number of reference sources to determine word meanings when context
clues or knowledge of root words isn’t enough to help you figure out a
word’s definition.*

    these words will help you to determine the meaning of unknown words
    in your reading in this course and beyond. After watching the
    lesson, navigate down the page and review the copies of the slides
    from the lesson that are located below the video. Take notes on the
    main types of context clues, noting any examples that that you think
    would be helpful to you.

**1.2 Reading Literature: Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea** <span
id="1.2"></span> 
Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea *is a classic work of fiction that
was written by Jules Verne in 1870. This story is especially unique
because it is one of the first science fiction novels ever written. You
are going to read this novel, and as you read, you will use a number of
reading and vocabulary strategies to help you think about and make sense
of your reading.*

**1.2.1 Reading Comprehension Strategies** <span id="1.2.1"></span> 
-   **Explanation: Next Vista for Learning: Julie Presant’s “Reading
    Strategies”**
    Link: Next Vista for Learning: Julie Presant’s [“Reading
    Strategies”](http://www.nextvista.org/reading-strategies/) (Flash)  
        
     Instructions: As you learned to read, you were taught how to
    utilize numerous strategies to aid in your comprehension of text.
    These strategies include previewing, predicting, inferring,
    summarizing, and evaluating your comprehension. Because these
    strategies help you make meaning of what you have read, they give
    you insights into the text. Sometimes, despite your best attempts at
    using all the reading strategy tools that you have to help you, you
    get stuck. At this point, you have a break in your understanding,
    and you must go back and reread a section or consult an outside
    reference to clarify. If you don’t attempt to fix this break in your
    understanding, your overall comprehension of the text will begin to
    break down as well.  
        
     Annotation is a reading strategy through which the reader interacts
    with a text by marking the text with reactions, questions,
    connections, and other thoughts. It is a strategy that we will
    employ throughout this course. When I annotate a text and find
    myself using a reading strategy such as predicting or inferring for
    example, I mark a “+” in the margins of the text to indicate that I
    have an insight into the text at that point. Then I usually jot down
    a few words to describe that insight. If I find myself stuck on a
    word, or having trouble comprehending a section, I indicate the
    break in my understanding with a “-” and a few words describing what
    I did to get back on track.  
        
     After watching this video lesson and reading this description of
    annotation and insights, you should prepare to annotate your
    insights throughout your reading of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under
    the Sea.  
        
     Reading these instructions, watching this video lesson, and taking
    optional notes should take approximately 15 minutes.

     Instructions: Now that you’ve reviewed some vocabulary and reading
    strategies to help you comprehend this story, it’s time to dive into
    Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea! The novel is divided into two
    main parts, with each part broken into chapters. Read the entire
    story and annotate your thinking about insights and breaks in your
    reading comprehension. Once you have read at least the first part of
    the story, you may move on to the subunits below that will help you
    explore the story elements of character, plot, conflict, and theme.
    Your annotations will help you analyze the story elements present in
    the story in the lessons that follow.  
        
     Reading this novel from beginning to end and annotating your
    thoughts as you read should take approximately 18 hours.

     Instructions: Read this essay explanation on the different types of
    conflict possible in narrative writing. Take notes on any
    information that is new to you or that you feel could be helpful to
    your reading comprehension. After reading the essay, watch the video
    clip under the “Human vs. Machine/Technology” section. You do not
    need to complete the conflict assessment mentioned below the video
    clip. You should, however, think about the types of conflict that
    you have noticed developing in *Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the
    Sea*.  
        
     Most lengthy novels, including Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the
    Seahave more than one type of conflict that develops through the
    story’s plot events. As you continue reading this story, try to
    identify and classify at least one example of a man versus man
    conflict, man versus society conflict, man versus nature conflict,
    and man versus machine/technology conflict that occurs at some point
    during this story’s plot. Creating a page in your notes to identify
    and classify these conflicts may be helpful to you as you prepare
    for the end of unit assessment.  
        
     Reading this explanation and essay and taking notes should take
    approximately 30 minutes.

    Link: Next Vista for Learning: Mark Ooka’s
    [“Theme”](http://www.nextvista.org/theme/) (Flash)  
        
     Instructions: The theme of a story is a universal lesson that can
    be applied in situations existing beyond the text. Sometimes the
    theme is a lesson that a character learns that you in turn could
    also learn from. Other times, a reader can learn a universal lesson
    from cause-and-effect relationships that unfold throughout a story’s
    plot. Because theme isn’t something that is clearly spelled out
    during a story, it is often difficult to pinpoint and is typically
    the most debatable and discussed story element.  
        
     Watch the video lesson provided in this subunit to help you think
    about the concept of theme. The teacher provides examples of themes
    in some familiar texts. Once the video is over, jot down some of the
    themes or lessons that you think Jules Verne wanted readers to learn
    from *Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea*. Write a few paragraphs
    in your notebook about these themes, and identify examples from the
    story to support your thinking.  
        
     Watching this lesson and writing about themes from our novel should
    take approximately 30 minutes.
