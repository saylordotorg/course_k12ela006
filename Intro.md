Sixth-grade Language Arts marks a turning point for you in your academic
career. After developing and practicing the skills necessary to develop
a strong foundation for your success at the elementary level, you are
now ready to embark on the next step in your journey as a reader and
writer. Based on the Common Core State Standards, this course will help
you grow as a reader and writer of both literary and informational text.
You will read a number of complex, thematically related narratives,
short stories, extended informational texts, and nonfiction articles.
You will learn to analyze these varied texts, to identify key ideas and
details, to compare and contrast major text elements, and to distinguish
between those claims supported by evidence and those that are not. You
will then try your hand at writing your own arguments and supporting
them with research-based evidence, and you will work to improve your
writing by taking it through the steps of the writing process. In your
own life, these reading and writing skills will benefit you immensely no
matter what path you choose to take in your future. Professional
athletes, doctors, accountants, teachers, salespeople, politicians,
scientists, and technology gurus read, write, communicate, and
collaborate on a daily basis. The goal through all of this is to help
you become a reader, writer, and communicator capable of critical
thinking and analysis, so that as you continue on your learning journey,
you have the tools and foundation you need to succeed.

 **Course Designer:** Amy Kasten  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course has been created using free online
texts and tutorials. All of the texts come from [Project
Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/), while the majority of
instructional tutorials are from [SOPHIA](http://www.sophia.org/).  
    
 **Requirements for Completion: **In order to successfully complete this
course, you will need to work through all assigned readings and
associated tasks. In addition to the assignments, which will help you
learn the skills and concepts from each unit, you will need to complete
brief assessments at the end of each unit. Though the final exam will be
the only graded task, completing the assignments and assessments is
necessary, as they will help you evaluate your learning.  
    
 In order to pass the course, you must earn a grade of 70% or higher on
the final exam. You may take the exam more than once, if necessary.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** Completing this course should take you a total of
approximately 102 hours and 45 minutes. Each unit includes a “Time
Advisory” that lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on
each subunit. It is recommended you devote about an hour a day, five
days a week, to working your way through the course. This is the same
amount of time you’d spend in a typical English class. If you are able
to complete your studying at the same time every day, this will go a
long way toward helping you develop strong study habits.
