**Unit 3: Oh My Word** <span id="3"></span> 
*Words are arguably one of the most powerful tools existing on this
Earth. When connected with other words, they have the power to become
magical stories and messages of hope, letters of love, and tales of
courage. Words have the power to hurt - they can incite panic and fear,
cause anger and hatred, and sometimes divide people. But words can also
calm, express love and friendship, unify people despite differences, and
allow for the spread of knowledge. The ability to speak, read, and write
words may truly be the greatest gift of humanity.*  
    
 *In this unit, you will use poetry as a means for exploring the many
dimensions of these almighty and powerful words. You will learn about
the functions of different types of words in the English language as you
explore the parts of speech. You will learn how many words’ definitions
are derived from the meanings of word roots and affixes, and you will
study some of the most common word parts. Furthermore, you will examine
how many words and phrases have come to have meanings that extend beyond
their literal definitions by exploring the beauty of figurative language
in poetry*

**3.1 Parts of Speech** <span id="3.1"></span> 
*Earlier in your academic career, you learned that different words have
different functions in sentences. For example, some words are verbs and
show action or state of being. Other words are nouns, which are people,
places, things, or ideas. The following lessons are designed to help you
review the parts of speech that you have previously studied, as well as
to help you focus specifically on pronouns, the part of speech that you
will be expected to know how to masterfully use in your speaking and
writing by the time you complete this course.*

**3.2 The Building Blocks of Words** <span id="3.2"></span> 
*As you learned during Unit 1 of this course, the English language is
rooted in words and phrases from many other world languages. Latin and
Greek are two of the languages that many English words are borrowed
from, and many of the words that you use each day include Latin or Greek
word parts. The lessons that follow will help you continue to build your
knowledge of root words, which in turn help you to increase your
vocabulary.*

**3.2.1 Greek and Latin Roots, Part I** <span id="3.2.1"></span> 
-   **Explanation: Open High School of Utah’s “Root Words”**
    Link: Open High School of Utah’s [“Root
    Words”](http://openhighschoolcourses.org/mod/page/view.php?id=6391) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: This reading gives a background about root words and
    their importance in building vocabulary. Read through this list and
    familiarize yourself with the roots and their meanings. Then, make
    flash cards - on paper or using a free flash-card-making website
    such as Quizlet - for each of these root words and any additional
    examples you may find. These flashcards will be a useful tool for
    you to use to study the root words. By the end of this course, you
    should have familiarized yourself with the meanings of all of the
    root words and affixes presented. Your knowledge of these word
    parts’ meanings will help you to figure out the meaning of
    unfamiliar words that contain these roots and affixes.  
        
     Reading about root words, making flashcards, and reviewing
    flashcards should take approximately 1 hour.

**3.3 Figurative Language** <span id="3.3"></span> 
*Figurative language refers to speech or writing that uses words in a
non-literal way to create a special meaning or effect. Often, figurative
language is used as a way to compare things that don’t appear to be very
similar. Some types of figurative language include similes, metaphors,
personification, alliteration, and idioms.*

**3.3.1 Connotation and Denotation** <span id="3.3.1"></span> 
-   **Explanation: SOPHIA: Sydney Bauer’s “Connotation and Denotation”**
    Link: SOPHIA: Sydney Bauer’s [“Connotation and
    Denotation”](http://www.sophia.org/connotation-denotation/connotation-denotation-tutorial) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Open the tutorial as well as your notebook so that
    you’ll be ready to take notes on this concept. Understanding the
    difference between denotation, the literal definitions of words, and
    connotation, the created meanings of some words and phrases, is
    essential to truly understanding the English language. Scroll to the
    bottom of this tutorial and first listen to the audio commentary
    provided for this lesson. As you’re listening, take notes on any key
    ideas that are new or sound especially important to you. After
    listening to the audio, read through the text and take any
    additional notes you feel will help you master the difference
    between connotation and denotation. It is very important for you to
    understand that many words and phrases have created meanings, or
    connotations, as this will aid in your comprehension of poems and
    other texts with complex figurative language.  
        
     Completing the activities and taking notes should take
    approximately 15 minutes.

**3.3.2 Similes and Metaphors** <span id="3.3.2"></span> 
**3.3.2.1 Similes and Metaphors** <span id="3.3.2.1"></span> 
-   **Explanation: SOPHIA: LaShanda Lawrence’s “Similes and Metaphors”**
    Link: SOPHIA: LaShanda Lawrence’s [“Similes and
    Metaphors”](http://www.sophia.org/similes-metaphors/similes-metaphors-tutorial) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Open to a new page in your notebook and title it
    “Similes and Metaphors.” Read through the slides provided in this
    tutorial and take notes on what similes and metaphors are, examples
    of them, and key words and ideas describing the differences between
    the two.  
        
     Similes and metaphors are two of the most frequently used forms of
    figurative language that you will come across in your reading, and
    chances are that this is not the first time you’ve learned about
    them. However, at this point in your academic career, you should
    work to become skillful at not only identifying similes and
    metaphors, but also at being able to explain what similes and
    metaphors mean. For example, as a younger student, you were probably
    applauded for being able to find a simile, such as “She was like a
    toddler when she went ice skating,” and correctly identify it as a
    simile. However, now, you should be able to explain that this simile
    means that the person wasn’t a very good ice skater and was probably
    pretty unsteady on ice skates.  
      
     Completing the activities and taking notes should take
    approximately 15 minutes.

    [“Metaphors”](http://www.sophia.org/metaphors/metaphors-tutorial) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Now it’s time to add to your notes on similes and
    metaphors. In the last lesson, you focused on exploring the
    definitions and differences between the two types of figurative
    language. In this lesson we’re focusing more on metaphors, as they
    are usually the type of figurative language that readers have a more
    difficult time understanding. Read through the slides provided in
    this tutorial and take any additional notes on metaphors to help you
    more deeply understand how to identify and analyze these unique
    comparisons in text.  
        
     Reading this tutorial and taking notes should take approximately 15
    minutes.

**3.3.3 Idioms** <span id="3.3.3"></span>

    Link: SOPHIA: LaShanda Lawrence’s
    [“Idioms”](http://www.sophia.org/idioms/idioms-tutorial) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: During this lesson, you will be adding to your notes
    on figurative language by analyzing idioms. Idioms are phrases that
    have developed connotations, which you will recall mean created
    meanings that differ from the literal dictionary definitions of
    words. To a person who is just learning the English language, these
    idioms can be very confusing! For example, a common idiom is “break
    a leg,” which means “good luck.” Imagine how upset you might feel if
    you were unaware of the meaning of this idiom and someone told you
    that they hoped you broke a leg! You would most likely be offended
    and perhaps pretty upset.  
        
     Even to expert English-language speakers, some of these idioms are
    just plain strange. This brief tutorial explains further what idioms
    are and gives some examples of common idioms and their meanings. As
    you view each slide, take notes on idioms, examples, and their
    meanings. You will be responsible for explaining idioms during your
    upcoming midcourse examination.  
        
     Completing the activities and taking notes associated should take
    approximately 15 minutes.

    Link: SOPHIA: Sydney Bauer’s
    [“Hyperbole”](http://www.sophia.org/hyperbole/hyperbole-tutorial) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: You will continue to add to your figurative language
    notes as you read through the slides presented here covering the
    figure of speech known as hyperbole. Hyperbole (which sounds like
    hi-per-bowl-lee) is the exaggeration of something for effect. Have
    you ever said that you were freezing when, in reality, your body was
    actually not turning into ice? Have you ever complained that you had
    a ton of homework when in reality you did not have 2,000 pounds
    worth of assignments? These are examples of hyperbole. Odds are,
    once you think about it, you’ll realize that you use hyperbole quite
    often without even realizing it.  
        
     Completing the activities and taking notes associated should take
    approximately 15 minutes.

     Instructions: This will be the last type of figurative language
    you’ll study before you dive into reading and analyzing figurative
    language in poetry. Review the tutorial on personification, and add
    to your figurative language notes as you read through the slides.
    Personification, which is a word that you may notice begins with
    “person,” is a figure of speech in which something that is not a
    person is given human qualities. This tutorial will help you to
    explore and clarify this concept. Once you have finished reviewing
    it, try your hand at writing some examples of personification in
    your notebook following your figurative language notes.  
        
     Reviewing the tutorial and taking notes should take approximately
    15 minutes.

    Poetry”](http://www.sophia.org/bits-on-poetry-tutorial) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read through this tutorial and watch each of the
    video lessons (although the last one doesn’t work, so skip it). They
    review different types of figurative language, some that you have
    already studied in this unit. This tutorial will help you take your
    knowledge of figurative language and use it to analyze figurative
    language in poetry.  
        
     Completing the activities and taking notes should take
    approximately 15 minutes.

**3.4.3 Reading and Analyzing Poetry** <span id="3.4.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: K12 Handhelds: Annotated Anthology of Poetry**
    Link: K12 Handhelds: [Annotated Anthology of
    Poetry](http://k12opened.com/ebooks/ela/ebook-poetryanthology/index.html) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this electronic poetry anthology textbook from
    the beginning to end. It includes 12 classic poems, and each poem is
    followed by a few questions and/or activities that will help you to
    extend your thinking and comprehension of the poems. Complete every
    question and activity for each assigned poem in your notebook. Also,
    if you come across unfamiliar words as you read these poems, be sure
    to carefully consult the glossary section at the end of the text.
    The glossary includes a long list of words and will be helpful to
    you in determining the meaning of unknown words, as poetry often has
    fewer context clues than longer texts.  
        
     Reading this text and completing all questions and activities
    should take approximately 3 hours and 30 minutes.

    Narrative”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/K12ELA6-3.4.4-Comparing-and-Contrasting-Poetry-and-Personal-Narrative.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: During this activity, you will compare the
    similarities and analyze the differences between two texts; one
    being the poem “Casey at the Bat” from the textbook you read in
    Subunit 3.4.3, and the other being the personal narrative that you
    wrote during Unit 2. Be sure to think about the genres, story
    elements, and structures of the texts as you compare them. You may
    be surprised by how many similarities exist between the two, despite
    the major differences that you’ll identify as well.  
        
     Completing this activity should take approximately 30 minutes.
